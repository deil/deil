# My Tech Stack

Just keeping track of what I'm using and how it evolves over time.

## Late 2025

### Highlights
- **AI-assisted programming**: So many cool tools! 🤯 There are MANY tools out there and I'm trying a lot of them. It brings me so much joy and enables me to build much crazier projects.
- **Windows 11** doesn't boot anymore. Not even trying to recover it. Goodbye. 👋
- Adopting **mise** because it just makes version management way easier.
- Discovered **TUI AI agents** (and tools like **lazygit**) and honestly? I'm liking them more and more.
- Even though **Spring Boot 4** and **Java 25** are out, I've got too much legacy code stuck on **Spring Boot 2.7**. Still grinding through that migration. ☕️
- Going full **Kotlin** for most new JVM code. It's such a breath of fresh air.
- Finally managed to migrate most of my Angular codebases from 13 to 18+! Signals, standalone components, and lots more. ❤️
- Realized that **TypeScript** isn't just about interfaces and classes – it's about the *shapes* of objects. That's a very different concept and it's freaking cool. (Thanks to [Matt Pocock](https://x.com/mattpocockuk)!)

### Backend
- Java 21 & Kotlin with Spring Boot 2.7 (legacy constraint).
- [JSpecify](https://jspecify.dev/): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lbxq6LP7FY
- **AI**: While there is Spring AI, I decided to give [Koog](https://docs.koog.ai/) a try. Built only a few simple agents, haven't formed my opinion yet.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Angular 20
- **UI**: Angular Material

### IDEs & AI
- **Cursor**: My go-to for frontend stuff and writing docs.
- **Claude Code**: For headless stuff and scripting.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Still the king for heavy Java backend work.

### MCP Servers
- **BrowserMCP**
- **IntelliJ**
- **Atlassian**
- **Figma**

### Dev Tools
- **[Podman Desktop](https://podman.io/)**: For managing Docker containers on macOS.
- **[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)**: Handles all my tool versions (Java, Node, etc.).
- **[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)**: My Git GUI.
- **[lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)**: TUI for git (still learning, but it's cool).

### OS
- **macOS**
- **Linux**: Currently trying to switch to [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) (totally following the hype train on this one!).

## 2024

### Dev Tools
- **[SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)**: Managed my Java versions.
- **[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)**: Managed Node.js.

### OS
- **Windows 11**
- **Ubuntu**
